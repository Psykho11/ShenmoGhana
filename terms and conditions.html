  6. ABOUT ABACUS AND MENTAL MATHEMATICS <br>
The Abacus mental math system has a rich history, stretching back 3,000 to ancient Rome, <br>
Mesopotamia, and China. Considered by many as a proto-type computer, abaci come in many forms <br>
and are used for mathematical calculations ranging from simple addition and subtraction to more <br>
complicated problems involving multiplication, division, and square or cube roots. <br>
Whereas mainstream education tends to categorize subjects to emphasize the left or right side of the <br>
brain, mental math is built on a holistic, whole-brain approach. In most schools today, there is an <br>
obvious split between students who excel in math and science versus those who perform well in <br>
language or the arts. Studies show that when we activate both sides of the brain, incorporating both <br>
logic and creativity, we can enhance not just mathematical processing, but overall ingenuity and <br>
problem-solving skills. <br>
Fun Mental Math is based on scientific research in neurology and psychology, studying the <br>
development of children’s brain and intelligence. It derives from abacus mental math and trains the <br>
most crucial brain functions and cognitive skills, such as attention, observation, memory, imagination, <br>
and reaction.
